# Heretic
A RPG game based on Hetic

Heretic is the first project i ever developped with the help of a friend of mine who made all the assets.
It was a project where we had to make a textual RPG game in less than 2 months (actually 1 month of real work in parrallel of studying).
It is a reproduction of Hetic where i'm a first year student.

To play the game you will need Python and Pygame.
